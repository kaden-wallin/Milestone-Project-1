# Milestone-Project-1
The first milestone project in my bootcamp

This game is a set of four triva games for shows that I have watched dozens of times.

This game is very simple to play, you just need to click on the title of a show you want to play and it'll take you to a quiz and then you just answer the questions. At the end you'll have a submit button and a return hub button, they do exactly what their names would imply.

My inspiration for the game was otherwise useless knowledge of my favorite shows and old flashgames

I used Github and VSCode to build my game
